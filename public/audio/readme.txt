// This is a placeholder for the engine loop audio file.
// In a real scenario, this would be a binary .mp3 file.
// Since I cannot create binary files directly, I will disable the EngineAudio component
// or point it to a valid URL if possible, or instruct the user.
// For now, I will create a dummy empty file to prevent 404, but "Unable to decode" will persist if empty.
// I will try to use a data URI in the code instead to fix this fully.
